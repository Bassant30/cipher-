# Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder

This is a simple C++ console application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm.

## 🔐 What is Caesar Cipher?

Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

Example:  
If the shift is 3, A becomes D, B becomes E, etc.

## 💡 Features

- Encrypt any message using Caesar Cipher
- Decrypt messages with a known shift key
- Input validation for text and shift key
- Simple and user-friendly console interface

## 🧪 Sample Usage

```text
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
Enter your choice: 1
Enter the message: hello
Enter the shift key: 2
Encrypted message: jgnnq
